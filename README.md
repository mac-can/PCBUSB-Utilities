# Running CAN and CAN FD on Mac&reg;

The PCBUSB library realizes a CAN to USB user-space driver under macOS for PCAN USB interfaces from PEAK-System Technik, Darmstadt.
It supports up to 8 PCAN-USB or PCAN-USB FD devices.

The dynamic library libPCBUSB is running under macOS 10.13 and later (x86_64 architecture).
Since version 0.10.1 it is running under macOS Big Sur (11.x) and later as Universal macOS Binary.  

See the [MacCAN](https://www.mac-can.com/) website to learn more.

## PCBUSB Utilities

This repo offers two command line tools that are build upon the PCBUSB library:
- `can_moni` to view incoming CAN messages
- `can_test` to test CAN communication

### can_moni

`can_moni` is a command line tool to view incoming CAN messages.
I hate this messing around with binary masks for identifier filtering.
So I wrote this little program to have an exclude list for single identifiers or identifier ranges (see program option `--exclude` or just `-x`).
Precede the list with a `~` and you get an include list.

Type `can_moni --help` to display all program options.

### can_test

`can_test` is a command line tool to test CAN communication.
Originally developed for electronic environmental tests on an embedded Linux system with SocketCAN, IÂ´m using it for many years as a traffic generator for CAN stress-tests.

Type `can_test --help` to display all program options.

### Target Platform
